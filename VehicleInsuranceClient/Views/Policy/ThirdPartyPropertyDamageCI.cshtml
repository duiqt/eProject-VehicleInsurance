                                With Third Party insurance, damage to your own car is generally an out of pocket expense. However, our Third Party levels of cover can provide some additional cover if you have an not at fault incident uninsured driver and you can provide the uninsured driver's details, up to a maximum market value of $5,000.

                                Market Value is an assessment of the value of the vehicle at the time of the incident based on its age and condition. Because it is not a fixed amount, you won’t know how much compensation you’ll receive if you need to make a claim.

                                Agreed value is the amount you will be reimbursed in the event of a claim where your car is in which your car is declared a total loss and is agreed on by you (the car owner) and the insurer. The agreed value amount is agreed upon by the car owner and their insurer. Because it is a fixed amount, it provides more certainty on what compensation you can expect if your car is considered a write off after an accident.
